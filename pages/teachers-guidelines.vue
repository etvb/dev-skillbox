                  You are able to share documents in Zoom’s virtual classroom. So use this

                  A lesson starts at the full hour and ends 45 minutes afterwards. Try to be in
                  the virtual class room 1-2 minutes before the class starts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should politely inform your student that the lesson is about to end. It is
                  important that you end the lesson on time as you might prepare for the next
                  class. It is also in the student’s interest as she/he might have other plans as
                  well.

              In the beginning of each lesson introduce yourself quickly in case it is the first class
              with this student and inform the student what she/he can expect in the next 45
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The student has your full attention. Ensure that you will not be disturbed during the
              class by your kids, a call, any loud noises and such.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a student does not show up on time, please stay in the virtual class room at least
              for 20 minutes. She/he has paid for the lesson and you will receive the money
              anyway. We recommend to take print screens if a student does not show up in case
              of disagreements.

          <ul>
            <li>
              You are the teacher, so behave this way. Omit to use inappropriate language. Instead
              stay professional at all time.

                  Skillzzbox does not tolerate teachers trying to take students off its platform.
                  Any violation will end in deactivating the teacher’s account and confiscate any
                  open balances.

                <li>
                  If a student wants to book you directly insist on using Skillzzbox. Let her/him
                  know that this is not acceptable and inform Skillzzbox support. This ensures
                  you that your personal financial account details are kept private and a certain
                  distance. Further the more ratings and positive comments you receive from
                  other students, the more lessons you sell.

              Don’t start doing favors for students such as translations, conversations via Zoom, or
              chatting outside lesson times. It will be difficult to stop it again without any negative
              vibes. You are paid for the lesson and not for any extra work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t force the student to give you good feedback. Students can freely express their
              opinions unless they violate any common sense of decency. Please report such
              inappropriate comments to Skillzzbox support.
